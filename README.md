# AI-vs-Human-text-detection
A project to detect whether text is AI-generated or human-written using NLP and machine learning. We use NLTK for preprocessing and a Random Forest Classifier to analyze text features and make predictions. This tool helps in identifying AI-generated content for research, moderation, or content authenticity checks.
